# OOP Introduction
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes. It focuses on creating objects that contain both data and functions.

## Procedural Programming
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that uses a linear or top-down approach. It focuses on functions or procedures to operate on data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Data**:
  - data 1
  - data 2
  - data n
  - data 3
- **Functions**:
  - Function 1
  - Function 2
  - Function k

### Characteristics:
- **Top-down approach**: The program is divided into small parts called functions or procedures.
- **Security**: Limited, as data is often exposed to the entire program.
- **Maintenance**: Can become difficult as the program grows larger.
- **Reusability**: Functions can be reused, but data and functions are separate, making it less flexible.

### Example:
```c
int data1;
int data2;

void function1() {
    // code
}

void function2() {
    // code
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Approach**: Bottom-up: The program is divided into objects.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Security: Enhanced through encapsulation and access modifiers.
  - Maintenance: Easier to maintain and modify due to modularity.
  - Reusability: High, as objects and classes can be reused across programs.
  - Implementation: Involves defining classes and creating objects that encapsulate data and functions.
  - Access modifiers: Control the visibility of class members (e.g., private, public, protected).
  - Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
  - Objects/Classes: Objects are instances of classes, which define the blueprint for the object.
  - Encapsulation:  Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within one unit.
  - Polymorphism: Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

### Introduction
- **What is OOP?**
  - Creating objects that contain both data and functions
  - Example:
    - Data 1, Data 2, Data n
    - Task 1, function 1, function 2, Task n

### Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming
- **Procedural Programming**:
  - Writing functions that perform operations on the data
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Objects contain both data and functions
  - Example:
    - Object 1: Data and Functions
    - Object n: Data and Functions

### OOP Advantages
- A clear structure
- Easier to maintain, modify, and debug
- Reusable

### Example in C
- **Structs**:
  - Doctor (struct)
  - Assistant (struct)
  - Waiter (struct)
- In C, the struct construct primarily supports simple, user-defined data structures with limited capabilities for expressing complex relationships.
